## About Me

Hey, I’m Ty! I specialize in integrating spatial movement into ecological and evolutionary processes using concepts from math and physics. My work focuses on relative motion, exploring how different parts of nature move relative to each other. Through a combination of theory, simulations, and experiments, I've shown that motion is a powerful ecological mechanism.

## Projects

### Data Cube for Ogallala Lakota College
Developing a comprehensive data cube to support data sovereignty and climate change research for the Ogallala Lakota College and the Rosebud Sioux Tribe.

### Climate Center for the Lakota People
Supporting Red Horse's initiative in running a new climate center focused on indigenous knowledge and modern science to address climate issues.

## Talks

### Predicting Migration in 3D
Exploring how spatial patterns emerge in migration.

### Biological Space-Time
Understanding the interaction of ecological components in space and time.

### A Revolutionary Migration
